# TRANSLATOR’S NOTE

Note that in the following translations, the numbers in square brackets refer to the Greek text, and the numbers without brackets refer to the English text. In the translation a shorter indented line is usually combined with the short line above it as a single line in the reckoning. Footnotes and introductory summaries at the start of each book have been provided by the translator.

In this English text, the possessive of names ending in -s is usually indicated in the customary way by adding ’s (e.g., Zeus, Zeus’s; Atreus, Atreus’s; and so on). This convention has the effect of adding a syllable to the word (the sound -iz). It also sometimes produces a rather odd-sounding result. Thus, for metrical and euphonic reasons, the possessive of a name is in places indicated by a simple apostrophe, without the s (an alternative fairly common in written English): e.g., Achilles’ anger instead of Achilles’s anger. This latter procedure does not add an extra syllable to the word. In the above example, Achilles’ has three syllables, unlike Achilles’s, which has four.
